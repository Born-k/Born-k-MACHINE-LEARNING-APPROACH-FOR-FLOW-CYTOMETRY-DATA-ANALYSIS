# Born-k-MACHINE-LEARNING-APPROACH-FOR-FLOW-CYTOMETRY-DATA-ANALYSIS

**Flow cytometry** is a powerful tool to study and to measure different parameters within the samples, which includes the quantification of various cell populations and the specific markers present on the cellâ€™s surface.the single cell
Applications: Immunology, molecular biology, bacteriology, virology, cancer biology and infectious disease monitoring. 

__Problems__:
High dimensionality of data 
No automation
Big data to visualize and explore clusters in 2D graphs through a manual tedious process.

__Aim__: 
To study and design learning (ML) based efficient Tool for clustering FCM data.
Each row of the tabular data will act as an input point in the multidimensional space where each column is a dimension.
The output will be the clusters and detailed information of the possible significant clusters of the input cells.
This will discard the manual labor that the expert oncologists have to perform monotonously in order to identify these clusters before inferring its medical consequences
